\hh{The Cluster}\n\t The cluster is built over the regular computer network with TCP/IP protocols.
We shall call a participant of the cluster as the \b{node}. A single instance of the \b{server} operates on each node.
The servers interacts with each other using the star topology.
A several number of \b{clients} operates on each node. Each client interacts directly with its server only.
The cluster net is decentralized. The topology information is maintained and stored by the servers.
The topology information is being synchronized on the basis of the PC time.
The cluster net allows its participants to exchange with \b{packages} with each other and implement several \b{services}.
\n\h{Services}\n\t The service (in general) is a set of functions and package verbs implemented by the net participant.
We consider service as a special property assigned to each participant. This property determines the functions implemented
and the usage of the user-defined packages. The participants may be enumerated by the service implemented.
The developer of the service defines a service identifier in the reverse-dns form (e.g. 'engine.cluster.node').
The 'engine.cluster' namespace is reserved and is used by the system.
\n\h{Packages}\n\t Package is the basic data block transmitted between the net participants. The package includes the data block,
server and receiver addresses and the package verb. The cluster net address has the form of LLSSSSSSNNNNIIII (64-bit number).
The addresses are allocated by the servers. LL is address level, it's equal to 01 for server and 02 for client.
\n SSSSSS is service index. The service indicies are allocated by the server on the basis of service identifier.
\b{It is warranted} that: 1) the clients implementing the same service within the same node the service indicies shall be the same.
2) the clients implementing different services within the same node the service indicies shall be different.
The service indicies may differ on each launch of the PC/server and on different nodes. The server always have the service index equal to 0.
\n NNNN is the node index. The node index is always non-zero. It's allocated to the node when the node joins the net and is constant further.
The net participants within the same node always have the same node index.
\n IIII is an instance index. It's allocated by the server to each client to enshure that its address is unique.
The server has its instance index always equal to zero.
\n The package verb is a 32-bit number. It specifies the usage of the package in the context of the sender and the receiver.
The verbs 00000000-7FFFFFFF are reserved and are used by the system.
The verbs 80000000-FFFFFFFF are used by the clients. Their usage is defined by the client's service.
\n\h{The Node Service}\n\t The node service is implemented by the servers. Its functions includes:\n
- the definition and the synchronization of the net topology,\n
- package routing between the different nodes,\n
- enumerating some hardware and software properties of the nodes,\n
- enumerating the topology information and the information on the participants connecte,\n
- the remote control over the power supply of the node,\n
- the power supply and computation status notifications.
\n\t The node addition, removal and shutdown is performed using the GUI of the server.
The information retrieval is performed using the server GUI, command-line tool 'ecfstat'
and programmatically using the ClusterClient API.
