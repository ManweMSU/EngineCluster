\hh{Server Management}\n\h{The Initial Setup}
\n\t On the first launch the server intiates the initial setup.
The user will be asked for the node name and UUID. The name has mainly decorative purpose and is presented to the user in several application.
The name can be used to address the node from the command-line tool 'ecfremc'.
UUID is a unique 128-bit node identifier. All the nodes must have different UUIDs.
Each node may participate in several clusters. It will have different addresses in each cluster but the constant UUID.
The system suggests the user with a random UUID. User is recommended to use it.
\n\h{Cluster Setup}
\n\t The cluster control panel is opened by the click in the cluster's icon in the system status bar.
The main control buttons are: \img{IconHelp} - invokes the documentation and the 'about' dialog,
\img{IconShutdown} - turns the server off. The close button in the panel's title hides the panel and moves the server to the background mode.
\n\t The 'Nets' tab provides user with the tools to configure the nets the server is participating.
The server can simultaneously participate in any number of nets, but only one may be active in the same time.
The server's services don't operate while the server is not active within any net.
The net deactivation leads to the disruption of all the connections with the servers and the clients and turns off the services.
The net has the name and UUID properties. The net management includes the next commands:
\n\img{IconCreateNet} - net creation. The user will specify the net name and UUID.
He also will be asked with the port number the server will operate on.
The UUID field is automatically filled by a random value, the port field by the default one (10666).
We suggests to use this values. A new, non-active net of only one (current) node will be created.
\n\img{IconJoinNet} - join net. In order to join an existing net the user must specify the IP address and the port
of any active node of this net. He also must specify the port his node will operate on.
The join will automatically synchronized with the other nodes of the net.
In order to join the net the net must be active on the target node and the join operation must be allowed by the user on that node.
\n\img{IconForgetNet} - exit net. Excludes the current node from the net selected.
The exclusion fact is synchronized with the other nodes if there are at least two active nodes on this net including the current one.
Otherwise the other nodes shall not be notified about the exclusion.
The net is considered to be destroyed when the last node exits.
\n\img{IconAutoconnectNet} - autoconnect. Makes the net selected to be autoconnected on the server launch.
If the net already has this status, the status will be removed. Only one net may have this status in the same time.
This property is private to the server and does not affects the other nodes. Its alternation doesn't lead to any changes in
the net state of the server.
\n\img{IconConnectNet} - connect. Makes the net selected the active one and starts the node services.
\n\img{IconDisconnectNet} - disconnect. Deactivates the net selected, disrupt all the connections and shuts down all the services.
\n\t The configuration of the net selected is performed via the 'Nodes' tab. The nodes of the net and their statuses are shown in the list.
This information includes the node's name, connection, power supply and spreaded computation statuses.
The connect and disconnect buttons are duplicated on this tab. It also provides the next commands:
\n\img{IconAllowJoinNet} - allows or disallows new nodes to join the current net via this node.
This property is private to this node, it equals to 'not allowed' by default and is being reset to this state after each successfull join.
\n\img{IconLeaveNet} - excludes the node selected from the net. The node will be notified about the exclusion if it's active.
\n\img{IconSelectNodes} - allows user to select the nodes that are allowed to be used in the spreaded computations.
\n\t Also the context menu (right-click) of each node has the next commands:
\n"Watch node services" - prints the list of all the cluster participants (both clients and the server) on the node selected:
their service names, service identifiers and addresses.
\n"Watch node information" - prints the information on the hardware and the software of the node, its name, address of the server and UUID.
\n"Interrupt work" - enforces the interruption of the spreaded computations on this node. Must be used in case of computation bugs.
\n"Server control" - allows user to shutdown the server, shutdown or restart the PC remotely.
