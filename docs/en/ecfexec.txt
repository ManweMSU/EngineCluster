\hh{The Manual Launch of the Spreaded Computations}\n\h{ecfexec}\n\t Performs a manual launch of the spreaded computations. Syntax:
\n\code{ecfexec <PACKAGE> [-a <NAME> <VALUE>] [-f <INPUT>] [-o <OUTPUT>] [-i <IP>] [-p <PORT>]}
\n PACKAGE - a package file with the computation kernel.
\n i - overrides the IP address of the node to connect. The default is 127.0.0.1.
\n p - overrides the port of the node to connect. The default is 10666.
\n f - uses a binary file specified as the input to the computation.
\n a - uses a reflected structure as the input to the computation.
This structure will have a field with name and value specified. The value will have the type Engine::ImmutableString.
Any number of such fields may be specified.
\n o - specifies a file used to store the output data of the computation.
